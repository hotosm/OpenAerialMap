OpenAerialMap (OAM)
===

Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it. OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a simple open way to host and provide access to imagery for humanitarian response and disaster preparedness.

There have been multiple tries to start OpenAerialMap in the past. This current interation is lead by the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org) through the gracious support of the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund](http://www.humanitarianinnovation.org/large-project/OpenAerialMap).

Please head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/hotosm/OpenAerialMap/wiki) to learn about current development, submit ideas in the [issues](https://github.com/hotosm/OpenAerialMap/issues) section, and contribute code through [pull requests](https://github.com/hotosm/OpenAerialMap/pulls).

Communication about the project currently happens on the [OAM-Talk mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/hotosm.org/forum/#!forum/openaerialmap). Please join the discussion and share your ideas.
