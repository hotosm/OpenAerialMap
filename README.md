# OpenAerialMap

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%202--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)

## Introduction

OpenAerialMap (OAM) is the largest public repository of openly licensed high-resolution satellite and drone imagery, fostering a community dedicated to improving access to critical geospatial data. OAM provides a simple, sustainable, and scalable platform for hosting, sharing, and discovering imagery, empowering humanitarian responders, disaster preparedness efforts, and countless other applications.

## Goals

*   Provide a **centralized platform** for accessing openly licensed satellite and aerial imagery.
*   **Simplify the discovery** of imagery through a user-friendly interface and API.
*   Allow contributors to **easily upload and share** their imagery.
*   **Enable collaboration** among organizations and individuals working with aerial imagery.
*   **Ensure long-term sustainability** through a distributed and scalable architecture.
*   **Promote the use of open imagery** for mapping in OpenStreetMap.

## Features

*   **Search and Discovery:** Easily find imagery based on location, date, sensor, provider, and other metadata.
*   **API:** Access imagery and metadata through a standardized API.
*   **Data Upload:** Contribute your own openly licensed imagery to the platform.
*   **Tiling Services:** Efficiently visualize large imagery datasets using dynamic tiling.
*   **Open Source:** The entire platform is built with open-source technologies and is available for community contributions.

## Technology Stack

OAM is built on a cloud-native architecture leveraging the following technologies:

*   **Backend:** Node.js, MongoDB
*   **Frontend:** React, Redux, Mapbox GL JS
*   **Infrastructure:** AWS (including S3, EC2, Batch, Lambda)
*   **COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF):** For efficient imagery storage and access

Please note: The aging OAM system presents increasing maintenance challenges due to its outdated design and technology. This impacts system reliability and maintainability. HOT and its partners are actively pursuing resources to modernize OAM.

## Current Status

In December 2024, HOT received a Cisco CyberGrant to modernize OAM.  This grant will fund the upgrading to a fully STAC-compliant architecture, improving scalability, interoperability, and maintainability.

**Key planned efforts include:**

*   Migrating the existing metadata database to a STAC catalog.
*   Developing a new STAC-based API.
*   Rebuilding the frontend to interact with the new API.
*   Updating the documentation.

**Future improvements will focus on:**
*   Improving the upload and processing pipeline.
*   Integrating OAM with other imagery processing software.
*   Supporting other imagery formats and raster data types (e.g. DTMs, DSMs, multispectral imagery, etc).
