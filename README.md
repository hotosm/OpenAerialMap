Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it. OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a **simple open way to host and provide access to imagery** for humanitarian response and disaster preparedness.

There have been multiple tries to start OpenAerialMap in the past. This current interation is lead by the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org) through the gracious support of the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund](http://www.humanitarianinnovation.org/large-project/OpenAerialMap).

Please head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/hotosm/OpenAerialMap/wiki) to learn about current development, submit ideas in the [issues](https://github.com/hotosm/OpenAerialMap/issues) section, and contribute code through [pull requests](https://github.com/hotosm/OpenAerialMap/pulls).

Communication about the project currently happens on the [OAM-Talk mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/hotosm.org/forum/#!forum/openaerialmap). Please join the discussion and share your ideas.
