OpenAerialMap (OAM)
===

## What is OpenAerialMap?
Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it. OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a **simple open way to host and provide access to imagery** for humanitarian response and disaster preparedness.

There have been multiple tries to start OpenAerialMap in the past. This current interation is lead by the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org) through the gracious support of the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund](http://www.humanitarianinnovation.org/large-project/OpenAerialMap).

## Repositories
