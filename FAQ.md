Q: What is OpenAerialMap (OAM)?
A: OpenAerialMap (OAM) is an open-source platform that provides a simple and open way to host, share, and access high-resolution aerial imagery from various sources, including satellites, drones, and other aircraft.

Q: What is the goal of OAM?
A: The goal of OAM is to make it easier for humanitarian organizations, disaster response teams, and researchers to access and use aerial imagery for a wide range of applications, including disaster response, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and more.

Q: How does OAM work?
A: OAM is built on top of OpenStreetMap, a collaborative mapping project, and uses the OpenLayers web mapping library to display imagery. The platform allows users to search for and browse aerial imagery by location and date, and to download images in various formats, including GeoTIFF and JPEG.

Q: What are some applications of OAM?
A: OAM can be used for a wide range of applications, including disaster response, urban planning, environmental monitoring, agriculture, and more. By providing access to high-quality aerial imagery, OAM can help support more effective and efficient decision-making in a variety of contexts.

Q: Is OAM free to use?
A: Yes, OAM is free to use and is available under an open-source license. However, some images may be subject to licensing or copyright restrictions, so users should be aware of the licensing terms for any images they access through OAM.

Q: How can I get involved with OAM?
A: There are several ways to get involved with OAM, including contributing imagery, providing feedback and suggestions, and contributing to the development of the platform. You can visit the [OAM website](https://openaerialmap.org/) or GitHub repository to learn more about how to get involved.
