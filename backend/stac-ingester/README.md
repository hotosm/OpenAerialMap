# OpenAerialMap STAC Ingester

This directory contains a deployment of the STAC ingester for HOTOSM based on the
STAC creation package, [stactools-hotosm](https://github.com/hotosm/stactools-hotosm).

## Getting Started

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage Python
dependencies.

Once `uv` is installed, you can install the dependencies by,
```
uv sync --all-groups
```
